"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template.

"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,

"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported.

12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,

14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically.

Footnotes:,,  ,,,
"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and settled in other ways (for example, in domestic currency or commodities) are included as memo items under Section IV.",,,,,
"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,
3See definition of monetary authorities in paragraph 21 of the Guidelines.,,,,,
"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,
9Reporters should distinguish potential inflows and potential outflows resulting from contingent lines of credit and report them separately in the specified format. ,,,,,
"10In the event that there are options positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported. However, in the case of cash-settled options, the estimated future infl ow/outfl ow should be disclosed. Positions are “in the money” or would be, under the assumed values.",,,,,
12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,
13Identify types of instrument; the valuation principles should be the same as in Sections I–III. The nominal/notional value of derivatives should be shown in the same format as for the nominal/notional values of forwards/futures in Section II and of options in Section III.,,,,,
14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically. Market values should be reported and the accounting treatment disclosed.",,,,,
16Identify types of instrument. The main characteristics of internal models used to calculate the market value should be disclosed.,,,,,
separately in the specified format.,,,,,

"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,

5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I.

"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,

5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and settled in other ways (for example, in domestic currency or commodities) are included as memo items under Section IV.",,,,,
"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,
3See definition of monetary authorities in paragraph 21 of the Guidelines.,,,,,
"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,
9Reporters should distinguish potential inflows and potential outflows resulting from contingent lines of credit and report them separately in the specified format. ,,,,,

"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported. However, in the case of cash-settled options, the estimated future infl ow/outfl ow should be disclosed. Positions are “in the money” or would be, under the assumed values.",,,,,
12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,
13Identify types of instrument; the valuation principles should be the same as in Sections I–III. The nominal/notional value of derivatives should be shown in the same format as for the nominal/notional values of forwards/futures in Section II and of options in Section III.,,,,,
14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically. Market values should be reported and the accounting treatment disclosed.",,,,,

"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,

5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II).

"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and settled in other ways (for example, in domestic currency or commodities) are included as memo items under Section IV.",,,,,
"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,
3See definition of monetary authorities in paragraph 21 of the Guidelines.,,,,,
"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,
9Reporters should distinguish potential inflows and potential outflows resulting from contingent lines of credit and report them separately in the specified format. ,,,,,
"10In the event that there are options positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported. However, in the case of cash-settled options, the estimated future infl ow/outfl ow should be disclosed. Positions are “in the money” or would be, under the assumed values.",,,,,
12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,
13Identify types of instrument; the valuation principles should be the same as in Sections I–III. The nominal/notional value of derivatives should be shown in the same format as for the nominal/notional values of forwards/futures in Section II and of options in Section III.,,,,,
14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically. Market values should be reported and the accounting treatment disclosed.",,,,,

"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,

5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,

"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported.

14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically.

"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and settled in other ways (for example, in domestic currency or commodities) are included as memo items under Section IV.",,,,,
"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,
3See definition of monetary authorities in paragraph 21 of the Guidelines.,,,,,
"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,

"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported.

12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,
13Identify types of instrument; the valuation principles should be the same as in Sections I–III. The nominal/notional value of derivatives should be shown in the same format as for the nominal/notional values of forwards/futures in Section II and of options in Section III.,,,,,
14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically.

"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and settled in other ways (for example, in domestic currency or commodities) are included as memo items under Section IV.",,,,,
"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,
3See definition of monetary authorities in paragraph 21 of the Guidelines.,,,,,
"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,
9Reporters should distinguish potential inflows and potential outflows resulting from contingent lines of credit and report them separately in the specified format. ,,,,,
"10In the event that there are options positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported. However, in the case of cash-settled options, the estimated future infl ow/outfl ow should be disclosed. Positions are “in the money” or would be, under the assumed values.",,,,,
12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,
13Identify types of instrument; the valuation principles should be the same as in Sections I–III. The nominal/notional value of derivatives should be shown in the same format as for the nominal/notional values of forwards/futures in Section II and of options in Section III.,,,,,
14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically. Market values should be reported and the accounting treatment disclosed.",,,,,

"1In principle, only instruments denominated and settled in foreign currency (or those whose valuation is directly dependent on the exchange rate and that are settled in foreign currency) are to be included in Sections I, II, and III of the Template. Financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and settled in other ways (for example, in domestic currency or commodities) are included as memo items under Section IV.",,,,,
"2Netting of positions is allowed only if they have the same maturity, are against the same counterparty, and a master netting agreement is in place. Positions on organized exchanges could also be netted.",,,,,
3See definition of monetary authorities in paragraph 21 of the Guidelines.,,,,,
"4In cases of large positions vis-à-vis institutions headquartered in the reporting country, in instruments other than deposits or securities, they should be reported as separate items.",,,,,
5The valuation basis for gold assets should be disclosed; ideally this would be done by showing the volume and price.,,,,,
6Including interest payments due within the corresponding time horizons. Foreign currency deposits held by nonresidents with central banks should also be included here. Securities referred to are those issued by the monetary authorities and the central government (excluding social security).,,,,,
"7In the event that there are forward or futures positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"8Only bonds with a residual maturity greater than one year should be reported under this item, as those with shorter maturities will already be included in Section II, above.",,,,,
9Reporters should distinguish potential inflows and potential outflows resulting from contingent lines of credit and report them separately in the specified format. ,,,,,
"10In the event that there are options positions with a residual maturity greater than one year, these should be reported separately under Section IV.",,,,,
"11These “stress tests” are an encouraged, rather than a prescribed, category of information in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Results of the stress tests could be disclosed in the form of a graph. As a rule, notional value should be reported.

12Distinguish between assets and liabilities where applicable.,,,,,
13Identify types of instrument; the valuation principles should be the same as in Sections I–III. The nominal/notional value of derivatives should be shown in the same format as for the nominal/notional values of forwards/futures in Section II and of options in Section III.,,,,,
14Only assets included in Section I that are pledged should be reported here.,,,,,
"15Assets that are lent or repoed should be reported here, whether or not they have been included in Section I of the Template, along with any associated liabilities (in Section II). However, these should be reported in two separate categories, depending on whether or not they have been included in Section I. Similarly, securities that are borrowed or acquired under repo agreements should be reported as a separate item and treated symmetrically. Market values should be reported and the accounting treatment disclosed.",,,,,
